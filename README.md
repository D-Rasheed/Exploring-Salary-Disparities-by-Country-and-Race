# Project Steps
This project will be carried out in the following stages:
Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Ensure data consistency and integrity.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize income distributions across demographic attributes.
Investigate correlations between variables.
Identify potential trends or patterns.
Feature Engineering:
Extract relevant features from demographic attributes if needed.
Prepare the data for machine learning models.
Machine Learning Models:
Select appropriate machine learning algorithms for prediction tasks.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train and fine-tune the models.
Results Deployment using Streamlit:
Build an interactive web application using Streamlit.
Display visualizations and insights from the EDA.
Allow users to explore the impact of different variables on income.
