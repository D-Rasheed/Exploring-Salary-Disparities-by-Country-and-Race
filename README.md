# Exploring-Salary-Disparities-by-Country-and-Race
Dataset Description
The dataset comprises the following attributes:

Age: The age of the individual.
Gender: The gender of the individual.
Education: The highest level of education attained by the individual.
Country: The country of residence of the individual.
Race: The racial background of the individual.
Years of Experience: The number of years of professional experience.
Salary: The income of the individual.
The dataset's comprehensive nature enables researchers to explore patterns and trends in income distribution across different demographic categories. By conducting thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), we can identify potential disparities or variations in earning potential. Moreover, the integration of years of experience as a variable allows for the investigation of how income varies based on both demographic characteristics and accumulated work experience.

# Project Steps
This project will be carried out in the following stages:
# Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Ensure data consistency and integrity.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize income distributions across demographic attributes.
Investigate correlations between variables.
Identify potential trends or patterns.
# Feature Engineering:
Extract relevant features from demographic attributes if needed.
Prepare the data for machine learning models.
# Machine Learning Models:
Select appropriate machine learning algorithms for prediction tasks.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train and fine-tune the models.
# Results Deployment using Streamlit:
Build an interactive web application using Streamlit.
Display visualizations and insights from the EDA.
Allow users to explore the impact of different variables on income.
